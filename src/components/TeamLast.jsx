              The Buddy Program is an onboarding initiative by Image. In this
              program, we onboard and welcome new recruits by partnering them
              with our seasoned employees to help them settle in and learn the
              ropes, both socially and professionally. With this initiative,
              Image not only helps them achieve their true potential but enables
              them to feel at home.

              One of the best ways to enhance knowledge and skills is through
              training. Providing employees with relevant and consistent
              training can help improve performance and efficiency in the
              workplace. <br />
              <br /> We constantly invest in training our staff to make them
              more effective and efficient.
